<small> A driven and data-interested Swedish-speaking Finn, with a background in quantitative research (PhD in psychology), who took the leap a few years ago and shifted from academia to industry. I am currently working as a Data Analyst at Bonnier News, Stockholm, Sweden. <small>

<small> I love to work with statistical programming both in Python and R. The passion towards data analysis started early during my time as a graduate student, grewing out from the limitations I noticed that the traditional statistical programs had in terms of statistical complexity and flexibility. Following some introduction courses in R at [datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com/), I was totally hooked. Since that, R has routinely served as my primary working tool. I have also experience in using database management systems (Google Cloud Platform, Google BigQuery), web analytics (Google Analytics), and data visualization tools (e.g., DataStudio and Power BI). <small>

<small> During my leisure time, I like to improve my statistical skills in machine learning (for demonstrations, see my [projects](https://danielfellman.github.io/projects/). I also enjoy to work out at the gym, and I am a huge fan of soccer (especially the English Premier league).<small>
