<small> I am currently a post doctoral researcher (PhD in Psychology) at Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. <small>

<small> I love to work with statistical programming both in Python and R. The passion towards data science started early during my time as a graduate student. It grew out from the limitations I noticed that the traditional statistical programs had in terms of statistical complexity and flexibility. Following some introduction courses in R at [datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com/), I was totally hooked. Since that, R has routinely served as my primary working tool, and I have also systematically been improving my statistical skills in machine learning both in Python and R (for demonstrations, see my [projects](https://danielfellman.github.io/projects/). I have also experience in using database management systems (mostly PostgreSQL), data visualization tools for business intelligence (e.g., Power BI, Tableau), and statistical softwares for hypothesis testing (e.g., SPSS, JASP). <small>

<small> During my leisure time, I enjoy to work out at the gym, and I am also a huge fan of soccer (especially the English Premier league).<small>
