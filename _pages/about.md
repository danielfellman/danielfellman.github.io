<small> I am currently a post doctoral researcher (PhD in Cognitive Psychology) at Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. <small>

<small> I love to work with statistical programming both in Python and R. The passion towards data science started early during my time as a graduate student. It grew out from the limitations I noticed that the traditional statistical programs had (e.g., SPSS and Excel) in terms of statistical complexity and flexibility. Following some introduction courses in R at [datacamp.com](https://datacamp.com/), I was totally hooked. Since that, R has routinely served as my primary working tools, and I have also systematically been improving my
statistical skills using various machine learning techniques (e.g., linear- and logistic regression, random forest, knn) and in database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). <small>
