I'm a post doctoral reseacher (PhD) at Ã…bo Akademi university. In my present research vacancy, I have been responsible for
totally five projects, each of them covering data manipulation in large-scale data sets, statistical modeling (e.g., predictive
modeling using regression techniques), and reporting of the results in the form scientific publications.

Over the past 3 years, R has routinely served as my primary working tools, and I have also systematically been improving my
statistical skills using various machine learning techniques (e.g., linear- and logistic regression, random forest, knn) and in database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
